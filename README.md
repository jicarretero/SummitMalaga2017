# Summit Utrecht, May 2017.

## Purpose
This are the Slides for my FIWARE Summit Presentation, and a little shell script which might help to understand how an image or snapshot downloaded from Fiware Lab can be converted can transformed to an Image which can be instantiated in othe Virtualization solutions, including KVM or Virtual BOX.

This Script and information is as is. I simply hope it can help, but they information and script examples are shipped with no warranty at all. They are just examples to illustrate my thoughts. No liability will be accepted for the use of these scripts, nor by me or my company, Fiware Foundation e.V.
